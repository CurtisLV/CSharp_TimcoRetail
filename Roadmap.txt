- CI/CD process
- Deploy the Desktop app to Blob storage for download
- Introduce a web-based inventory control system (Blazor?)
- Web based reporting
- A Xamarin Forms app for a mobile register


Phase 2 roadmap
1. Take advantage of .NET Core (moved to it but never used all major advantages of using to it)
2. Setup a simple taskboard in Azure DevOps
3. CI/CD process with Azure DevOps (move source code to Azure DevOps?)
4. Move API to Azure
5. Move the databases to Azure SQL
6. Deploy the desktop app to Azure Blob storage
7. Web-based inventory control system
